# CATZ Static Recompilation

Static recompilation of **Catz** (1996, PF Magic) from its 16-bit NE engine DLL
to native C for Windows 11. The engine — the famous "ball-and-stick" Petz
engine — lives entirely in `CATZDLL.DLL`; `CATZ.EXE` is just a thin window
shell. This project lifts the DLL to C and reimplements its Win16 API
dependencies on top of Win32/SDL2.

Built on the [pcrecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/pcrecomp) NE toolchain,
following the [elfish](https://github.com/sp00nznet/elfish) project (the proven
end-to-end NE→C recomp) as the structural template. The key difference: El-Fish
was a self-contained DOS-extender (TSXLIB); CATZ is a real Windows 3.1 app, so
the runtime is a **Win16 API shim layer** rather than DOS interrupt handlers.

## Target: CATZDLL.DLL

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Format | NE (16-bit segmented), Win16 DLL, PROTMODE |
| Compiler | Borland C++ (linker 6.1), XApt C++ engine class |
| Code segments | 50 (614,898 bytes) |
| Data segments | 9 |
| Instructions | 233,762 |
| Relocations | 17,423 |
| Exports | 1,263 (XApt class methods, Borland-mangled) |
| Cluster | All 50 segments are one connected component |

### Imported Win16 modules (the shim TODO list)

| Module | Refs | Unique | Recomp strategy |
|--------|------|--------|-----------------|
| KERNEL   | 468 | 32 | GlobalAlloc/Lock/Free → heap; file I/O; thunks |
| GDI      | 235 | 32 | DC/bitmap/palette/BitBlt → GDI32 or SDL2 |
| USER     | 200 | 51 | CreateWindow/messages/input → Win32 / SDL2 |
| SOSLIB03 | 48  | 37 | SOS audio (HMI) → SDL2_mixer |
| WIN87EM  | 6   | 1  | x87 emulation → native doubles |
| TOOLHELP | 5   | 2  | debug helpers → stub |
| WING     | 5   | 4  | WinG fast blit → SDL2 / DIB |
| MMSYSTEM | 4   | 3  | multimedia timer |

The single hottest import is **KERNEL @113 (250×)** — a Borland far-pointer
thunk to be identified via IDA.

## Pipeline

```
ne_parse   →  segments, relocations, imports, entry/export tables
ida_export →  authoritative function bounds + instruction heads + Win16
              ordinal→API names  (IDA Pro 9.1 headless / idalib)
ne_decode  →  IDA-assisted 16-bit disassembly (relocations resolved inline)
ne_lift    →  one C file per code segment; x87 → native doubles;
              far calls/imports resolved via relocations
gen_image      →  flat memory image of data segments + applied relocations
gen_segments_h →  cross-segment prototypes (link-clean)
gen_dispatch   →  indirect call/jmp dispatcher
gen_stubs      →  stubs for unresolved targets
runtime/       →  Win16 API shims (KERNEL/USER/GDI/SOS/WING) + CATZ.EXE host loop
```

## Layout

```
tools/      NE toolchain (adapted from elfish; win16.py replaces tsxlib.py)
runtime/    cpu.h (CPU+FPU model), Win16 shims, main host loop
src/        lifted C, one seg*.c per code segment (generated)
analysis/   recon outputs + IDA exports (win16_imports.json, ida_funcs.json)
build_data/ flat memory image (generated, gitignored)
game/       original binaries (gitignored, not redistributable)
```

## Building

```bash
cmake -B build -A Win32       # 16-bit origin → 32-bit native target
cmake --build build
```

## Status: Compiles, Links Clean, Runs Into DLL Init

The full lifted engine **compiles (0 errors, 0 warnings), links with zero
undefined symbols, and executes** — it loads the flat image, sets up the
selector→base map, calls the NE entry (`seg001_0000`, DLL init), and flows
through the Win16 init sequence before stalling on stubbed services:

```
dos_int21 → GETWINFLAGS → GLOBALALLOC → GETCURRENTTASK
          → ENUMTASKWINDOWS → MESSAGEBOX → GETMODULEFILENAME → (spins)
```

The stall is a bring-up artifact, not a defect: every Win16 import is a no-op
returning `ax=0`, so `GLOBALALLOC` yields NULL and the task/window flow spins.
From here it is Win16 API *implementation*, not reverse engineering.

### Pipeline results

| Stage | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Recon | 50 code segments, 233,762 instructions, 17,423 relocs, 1 cluster |
| IDA code map | 1,497 real functions, 191,187 verified code heads |
| Imports | 162 ordinals across 8 modules, all named by IDA |
| Lift | all 50 segments → 285K lines C; **0 unresolved far calls** |
| Glue | flat image (705 KB, 14,495 relocs applied); **0 unresolved stubs** |
| Build | `catz.exe` (12.6 MB), 0 errors / 0 warnings, link-clean |

### Remaining work (debug loop, prioritized)

1. **Implement Win16 shims**, init-path first: GlobalAlloc/Lock/Free (real
   heap+selector alloc via `cpu.h`), GetModuleFileName, task/window helpers,
   MessageBox (log + IDOK), GetTickCount (increment).
2. **USER message loop + GDI/WinG blit** → first rendered frame.
3. **0x66 32-bit operand prefix** in `decode16.py` (8,110 sites) — currently
   emitted as `db 0x66`; needs 32-bit operand decoding.
4. **`__AHSHIFT`/`__AHINCR`** huge-pointer constants (KERNEL @113, 250×) for
   correct far-pointer arithmetic in the flat memory model.
5. Minor lifter ops: `rcl`/`rcr` (111), `sahf` (68), 7 FPU TODOs.
