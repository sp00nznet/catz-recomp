/*
 * win32_backend.c - Back the Win16 USER/GDI window shims with real Win32.
 *
 * We run on Windows, so the recompiled 16-bit engine can drive a real window:
 *   - RegisterClass captures the guest's WNDPROC (a lifted seg:off) and
 *     registers a real Win32 class whose C WndProc bridges back into guest code.
 *   - CreateWindow makes a real top-level window; a small table maps the 16-bit
 *     guest HWND/HDC handles to the real ones.
 *   - GetMessage/DispatchMessage drive the real Win32 message pump; on each
 *     dispatched message Win32 calls host_wndproc, which calls the guest WNDPROC
 *     via the runtime far-call dispatcher (PASCAL args + far frame).
 *
 * Drawing (GDI/WinG) is layered on top as the engine calls it.
